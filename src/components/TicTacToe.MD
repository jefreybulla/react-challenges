# Tik Tak Toe

Welcome to the Tik Tak Toe interview. This interview is designed to explore how you approach new, open ended problems. At Mito, we often build new features in new parts of our codebase, so being able to ship something from scratch is important. 

## To-do
- Change X to O and O to X per turn
- Check if game ended

### Your Job

Your job is to build a playable tik tak toe game in React. By the end of the interview, about 25 minutes from now, our goal is to play eachother in tik tak toe. 

This goal emphasizes our desire to ship working code quickly. Use your best judgement to decide which features are required for us to play a game of tik tak toe in the next 25 minutes, and which features are nice to have's that we can add later. 

### Tik Tak Toe Rules 

Tik Tak Toe is a two player game. Players take turns marking the spaces in a 3x3 grid. One player is "X" and the other player is "O". The first player to place three marks in a row (veritcally, horizontally, or diagonally) is the winner. If no player has won after all nine squares are marked, the game is a tie.
